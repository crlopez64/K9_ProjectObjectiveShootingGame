TO DO OR IDEAS:

-> REORGANIZE WEAPONRY
	-> Placing any input for guns into PlayerInput (DONE)
	-> Test Gun Scripts
		-> Make them for the sake of the current way of making things. (DONE)
	-> Find out if scripts for where guns go are redundant
		-> Maybe?
			-> Choice Mercs and Abilities
				-> If Merc has 2 strong Abilities and one gets used up, the other must cooldown as well
				-> Most ability max use combinations should be 1/1; but should not assume that
					-> 
-> ANIMATION
	-> Hands only for First Person
	-> Whole body with meh animations for other perspective (and shadows)
	-> After finishing sprinting, do not shoot until gun is aiming to the crosshair
		-> Figure out how to spread out transition per gun for "prepare gun" (sprint -> idle) perks and stats?

-> MOVEMENT
	-> Sprinting left and right (more smooth?)
	-> Player "skips" when moving down slopes. Fix?
	-> Jumping and wall jumping.

!!
	-> Objectives not working anymore
	-> Person animation?
	-> Another CPU for damage looks
	-> Self damage?
